# SVD Word Embedding for Analogy Tasks

In this mini-project, I built a word embedding using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). I explored it's semantic properties and tested its performance on a large set of analogy tasks.

To best interact with this project, please view online or download the HTML.

**Note**: The co-ocurrence matrix used for the embeddings is unfortunately too large for GitHub, but it can be found [here](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs168/co_occur.csv).
